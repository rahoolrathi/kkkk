  *Figure 1: Department Student Tracker Entity Relationship Diagram*
* **Some helpfull commands***

  * `npx prisma generate // Generate Prisma client for database access`
  * `npx prisma migrate dev --name init // Apply initial database schema migration `
  * `npx prisma studio // To view and interact with the database visually `

### Repository [30%]

* **DeptStudentRepo Class**: Implement methods to interact with the database collections (departments and students).

#### Methods

```
getDepartments()                        // Return all departments
addDepartment(department)               // Add a new department
deleteDepartment(id)                    // Remove a department
getDepartmentStudents(id)               // Return all students for a given department
addStudent(student)                     // Add a new student
updateStudent(student)                  // Update a student
deleteStudent(id)                       // Delete a student
getStudent(id)                          // Get a specific student
```

## API Handlers/Routes [30%]

* **API Routes**: Implement route handlers that use methods from the DeptStudentRepo class.

#### Routes

```
GET /api/departments                              // Return all departments
POST /api/departments                             // Add a new department
DELETE /api/departments/:departmentId             // Delete a specific department
GET /api/departments/:departmentId/students       // Get all students for a department
PUT /api/departments/:departmentId/students       // Update a student in a department
```

## Implementation of the User Interface (35%)

For the template code for HTML and CSS, refer to the `page.module.css` and `templates.jsx` files located in the dept tracker project.

1. [15 pts] Create Department Home Page: Retrieve and display all departments and their students as shown in figure 2. You should render this componenet in the root `http://localhost:3000`
   ![Class Diagram](home-page.png "Class Diagram")
   *Figure 2: Department Home Page*
3. [15 pts] Add Department: Implement an "Add Department" feature that allowing users to add new departments. Once the user clicks on the Add Department button you should navigate them to `/departments/add ` which renders the form shown in figure 3.
